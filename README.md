# Writeups

An intentionally public-facing repo where I publish polished writeups of various CTFs and other challenges with the goal of improving and documenting my own learning.

- **I will never publish flags here.**
- **I will never publish information related to time-bound events until after the deadline has been reached and the event is officially closed.**

## Structure
- `pico-ctfs` - picoGym and other challenges
- `THM` - public challenges from TryHackMe

Each writeup includes:
- A description of the challenge
- My step-by-step process
- Relevant code snippets
- Screenshots or command output
- Takeaways / lessons learned
